# GBDK Example
This example Requires GBDK-2020 4.2.0 or higher (due to using `vsync()`)

PNG images placed in the res/hicolor folder will get automatically converted and compiled.

To use them, include the automatically generated header file (based on the png filename) and then use the `hicolor_start()` and `hicolor_stop()` functions.

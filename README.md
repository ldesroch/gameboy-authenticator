# Gameboy Authenticator

## Disclaimer
This project is for demonstration purpose only an is not intended to go to production in any way.
The prject is provided "AS IS" without any warranty and may contain dead code and ugly things. (you are warned)

## Proof of concept
Shared secret is hardcoded in both the gameboy rom and the keycloak authenticator.
A cleaner implementation could be done by generating the secret within keycloak then storing it in user attributes.
Then replacing the secret in the rom dynamically.
